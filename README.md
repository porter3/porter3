- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Document Summarizer web app
  - Main focus at the moment is handling some edge case file uploads
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bunch of stuff thanks to this project... more AWS functionality, aspects of Python and Spring I didn't know, some CSS framework stuff (mostly Material-UI)

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I got into this field (I'm a former personal trainer and strength coach)
